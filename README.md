The project idea which I chose was the one by Liz Cullison, who made an automatic grader which worked based on a list of students' test scores. 
I want to take this idea and expand upon it by allowing you to calculate a student's entire grade point, based on a list of their assignments.
The final product would take multiple lists (such as by csv) and output a list of every student's final letter grade.
