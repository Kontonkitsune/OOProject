I chose the project idea from Liz Cullison, who made an automatic grader which worked based on a list of students' test scores. 
I wanted to take this idea and expand upon it by allowing you to calculate a student's entire grade point, based on a list of their assignments.
The final product would take multiple lists (such as by csv) and output a list of every student's final letter grade.

However, this didn't end up panning out, so instead, I made a calculator similar to Jordan Zhang's idea. It's capable of taking a string equation as input, converting it into a set of instructions, and computing the output. It will not crash regardless of what the user inputs into it, and it accurately calculates results.
The only issue with the code is that some incorrect inputs will be accepted and calculated. An example is + * 4 8 6, which is computed as 4 + 8 * 6.
